# Roadmap

## Stuff to do

### MAJOR SHIT

- Actor type for 'mechs
- 'Mech scale weapons
- Room on the record sheet for cues and tags and all that
  - Some way to allow others to see them (that's more convenient than being an observer on everyone's sheet and having to open them all)

### QoL SHIT

- ~~Show weapon damage in chat card~~ (DONE)
- Think of a better way to link weapons to skills
  - Automatically add the 3 weapon skills + martial arts "weapon" to a new actor, with a 0 rank?
- Look for other things that can be rollable tables - Add them to a compendium
  - Crit effects
- Calculate the speed modifier for your target in 'mech-scale combat
- ~~Confirmation dialog for deleting skills~~ (DONE)

### FANCY BULLSHIT WHAT MIGHT BE HARDER THAN I THINK

- Auto-calculate speed mod if you target an enemy in 'mech combat
- Keep track of jumping with an active effect(s)
- Automatically show the target of an opposed roll the dice modifier box (requires sockets iirc)
