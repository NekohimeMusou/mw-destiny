# Roadmap

## Stuff to do

- Make the tab names on the char sheet more prominent
- Make the drop-down menus on the roll dialogs into radio buttons or something, because I think it's awkward the way it is
- Fix targeted rolls to use the token's name instead of the actor's
- Automatically roll on hit location table on weapon hit
- Leverage initiative tracker
  - Auto heat tracking
  - Track jump jet effects (status + active effect probably)
- Limited PC sheet
- XP tracking/automation
