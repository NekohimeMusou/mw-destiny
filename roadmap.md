# Roadmap

## Fixed in 0.7.4

- Can now select tokens as hardware pilots

## Stuff to do

- Auto heat movement/accuracy penalties
- Piloting as weapon skill (for hatchets etc)
- Automatically roll on hit location table on weapon hit
- Leverage initiative tracker
  - Auto heat tracking
  - Track jump jet effects (status + active effect probably)
- Limited PC sheet
- XP tracking/automation
- Buildings
  - Potential quick fix: Allow normal (vs. 2d6, 3d6, etc) rolls with weapons
- MASC
  - Would like to automate this with the combat tracker
  - For now, maybe just add a toggle you can check while it's your narration and uncheck afterward

## QoL/Low Priority

- More elegant way to designate tokens as pilots instead of actors
