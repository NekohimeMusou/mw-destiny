# Roadmap

## Stuff to do

### MAJOR SHIT

- Limited sheet so others can see cues etc.

### QoL SHIT

- Think of a better way to link weapons to skills
  - Automatically add the 3 weapon skills + martial arts "weapon" to a new actor, with a 0 rank?
- Calculate the speed modifier for your target in 'mech-scale combat
- Auto heat tracking and dissipation
  - Automatic dice modifiers/rolls

- Automatically show the target of an opposed roll (e.g. target of an attack) a dialog (or chat card?) to make their opposed roll
- Leverage initiative tracker
  - Automatically track/dissipate 'mech heat
  - Track jump jet effects (active effect probably)
