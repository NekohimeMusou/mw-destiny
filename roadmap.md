# Roadmap

- Added a manual heat dissipation button in case of shenanigans
- Target name is now more prominent in roll dialogs
- Irrelevant heat buttons are now dimmed for non-mech, non-aero units

## Stuff to do

- Have difficulty selector always appear; targeted tests are another radio button
- GM heat management
- Limited PC sheet
- XP tracking/automation
