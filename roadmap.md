# Roadmap

## Done

- Tie heat into init tracker
  - Add heat to "buffer" when weapons are fired; at end of narration, add buffer to current heat, subtract dissipation, apply effects
  - Make piloting tests automatically?
- Use active effect + status for jump jets
  - Also tie into init tracker

## Bugs

- "Roll Piloting Test" button doesn't work

## Stuff to do

- GM heat management
- Limited PC sheet
- XP tracking/automation

## QoL/Low Priority

- More elegant way to designate tokens as pilots instead of actors
- More elegant way to handle MASC
